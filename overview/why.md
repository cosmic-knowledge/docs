# Why

There's an abundance of platforms for writing, organizing, and searching knowledge. However, these platforms are often composed of disparate components or are implemented behind an opaque curtin. Others are well-thought-out, but aren't useful to the way I think, learn, and retrieve.

So I decide to make one myself, Quasipanacea. It's my personal panacea for personal knowledge management, purportedly.

It's wishlist of features includes:

- An interface system:
  - Simple
  - Intuitive
- A storage system:
  - Backed by the file system
  - Non-hierarchal storage, optionally hierarchal retrieval
- A plugin system:
  - Arbitrarily extensible
  - Dynamically loadable
  - Fully type-safe
- A collaboration system:
  - Something CRDT or OT-based
- Novel systems
  - Proper handling of data source types (bronze, silver, gold)
  - Localized schema and constraint system

What I'm not trying to do:

- Scale (each user has their own instance)

I'll write more detail later.
