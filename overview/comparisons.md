# Comparisons

Quazipanacea is most similar to a Knowledge IDE. But sometimes, it can be more meaningful to compare against things that already exist.

- Unlike Notion, quazipanacea:
  - stores all data on the local file system (no databases)
  - has no security / permission levers

- Unlike Obsidian, quazipanacea,
  - Similarly stores files on the local file system, but has a mechanism to abstract the file system for easier navigation (overviews)
