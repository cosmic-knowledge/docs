# Problems

- Area: Search Engines
  - Problem: Search engines cluttered with spam
  - Problem: Search engine marketshare held by singular entity
  - Solution: Tools like [Duck Duck Go][duck-duck-go], [Brave Search][brave-search], [Kagi][kagi], [You.com][you] help, but the SEO game remains
  - Solution: Shared world knowledge base for product recommendations, alternatives, facts, blogs, tutorials, schemas discovert etc.
  - Solution: Custom search for site:reddit.com, site:news.hackernews.com
- Area: Robust Schema Navigation and Modification
  - Problem: Given a schema of a mental model, cannot navigate, partition, edit, change view of schemas / subschemas / submodels
- Area: Experiments
  - Problem: Difficult to setup code experiments with existing tools across ecosystems
  - Solution: Tools like [CodePen][code-pen], [Godbolt][godbolt], [Rust Playground][rust-playground] help, but fragmentation remains
- Area: Identification of things across knowledge bases
  - Solution: Identifiers like ISBN, URL schemas, and reverse DNS help, but fragmentation remains
- Area: New Tools
  - Problem: High bar for creating new tools
  - Solution: Metaframeworks like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) help, but does not cover specialization, integration with existing tools
  - Research to application
  - Solution: OOTB solution for mkdocs, VuePress, Pelican, etc., generalized SSG integration
- Area: Learning
  - Solution: Jump-start learning new topics by using published schemas (and building a map relative to that)
- Area: Common Representations
  - Problem: No common way to dynamically represent numerical values (ex. blog post mentioning 12ft, but no conversion available)
  - Problem: Common representation of standards (in card/block form)
