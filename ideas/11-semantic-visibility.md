# Semantic Presentation

Sometimes, documents are read for different reasons. They include:

- Quickly scanning for keywords
- Refreshing a concept in terms of visuals or graphics
- Detailed understanding (proofs, explanation)
- Flash card format
- Ones corresponding to the [grand unified theory of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com)

A common set of semantic keywords could help make it easier to separate these concerns and ease document authoring.

Possible visibility choices include

- Text folding / expansion
- Text removal
