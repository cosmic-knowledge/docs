# Standardized Parameterization of Markup Presentation

A mechanism to parameterize information for sections of notes that "implement an interface". Support for complete categorial differences in presentation as well.

Use cases for this "dynamic granularity of the presentation of knowledge" include optimizing the presentation for different modes of access.

Categories of access include:

- Quickly scanning for keywords
- Refreshing a concept in terms of visuals or graphics
- Detailed understanding (proofs, explanation)
- Flash card format
- Ones corresponding to the [grand unified theory of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com)

This idea should be implemented generically such that any presentation type should be supported. Needs to have some way to visualize each "format" in the editor - naively expanding (like code folding) is overwhelming and hard to view and edit.
