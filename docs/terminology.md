# Terminology

After much deliberation; I decided to root the terminology from the taxonomy of astronomy.

Away with documents, groups, and pages! Definition resolution will be much more clear with reduced definition overloading...

## Terms

- _galaxy supercluster_: One per person
  - _galaxy cluster_
  - _galaxy group_
  - _galaxy_

- _galaxy_
  - _star_: a document with information
  - _nebula_: Rules for stars
		- _star_

- _star_
  - _molecules_: composer of atoms
  - _atom_: datum

- _telescope_,  _microscope_: Lens to view big / small thing something
  - is sort of perspective, of edit and view
  - Think DocBook styles, or plaintext edit vs live preview edit?

## Other

- No solar systems, planets, satellites right now

One choice is whether to choose 'planet' or 'star' for a 'document' or 'note':

- Planet is good because it's at the right scale
- Star is good because there are more ways to organize stars
